### News
* Aug. 2022: one paper has been accepted by _**ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)**.

* Jul. 2022: Check out this submission ["Fast and Structured Block-Term Tensor Decomposition For Hyperspectral Unmixing"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03798.pdf). Here we propose a new tensor decomposition-based algorithm for hyperspectral unmixing.

* Dec. 2021: one paper "Tensor completion via nonconvex tensor ring rank minimization with guaranteed convergence" has been accepted by _**Signal Processing**_.

* May 2021: one paper has been accepted by _**29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)**_, and two papers have been accepted by _**IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)**_.

* Dec. 2020: one paper "Hyperspectral Super-Resolution via Interpretable Block-Term Tensor Modeling" has been accepted by _**IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing**_.

* June 2020: Check out this submission ["Hyperspectral super-resolution via interpretable block-term tensor modeling"](https://MengDing56.gitHub.io/papers/20Arxiv_SCBTD_HSR.pdf). Here we propose a new tensor-based hyperspectral super-resolution.

* Feb. 2020: We submit ["Tensor train rank minimization with nonlocal self-similarity for tensor completion"](https://MengDing56.gitHub.io/papers/20Arxiv_Nonlocal_TT_TC.pdf). In this work, we propose a new nonlocal tensor train rank-based tensor completion method by exploring the nonlocal self-similarity prior of tensor data.
